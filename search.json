    "text": "The Houston Rockets have had their fair share of wins and overall great teams in many past seasons. The team has even won two National Basketball Association Championships in 1994 and 1995. In previous years, the Rockets have had a well-built team that played every area of the court. Yet, how have they evolved? They haven’t. They’ve regressed. Instead of playing to their strengths and seeking the chance to make it to the championships off of three points and rebounds, they have given over turnovers and made it fairly impossible to come back. Anyone who has watched the Houston Rockets play in the 1990s understands the excitement for a newly built team to collect wins back-to-back. It makes you wonder if the Houston Rockets can win another championship anytime soon.\nLet’s look at the Rockets through the years.\nSports Reference’s NBA site provides advanced information on the teams through the years. They happen to have wins and losses from different seasons.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nnbaadv &lt;- read.csv(\"nbateamadvanced.csv\")\n\ndiffnba &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; \n  mutate(Differential = w - l) |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  mutate(CumDiff = cumsum(Differential))\n\nHR &lt;- diffnba |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=diffnba, aes(x=season, y=CumDiff, group=team), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_step(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=CumDiff, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Seasons\",\n    y= \"Wins and Losses\",\n    title = \"The Rockets Have Fell Off\",\n    subtitle = \"The Rockets had a good win streak but are beginning to lose again.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference.com | By: Alana Ross\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Houston Rockets had fairly constant wins from 1994 to the early 2000s. The Rockets fell off going into the next 2010 decade and eventually came back. Let’s be honest, this is the beginning of the James Harden era. Mr. Fear the Beard brought a lot of success. Yet he left recently in 2019 and after the fact the win-to-loss rates are stagnant. The ratio stays stagnant until 2020 when there is a spike of wins until 2023. We start to fall off again.\nWhy do the Rockets fall off? Could it be rebounds? Could it be field goals? Could it be three-point averages? Maybe even a combination of all?\n\n\nCode\norbpct &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n   geom_line(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_point(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y= \"Offensive Rebound Percentage\",\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nfgpct &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n   geom_line(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_point(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y= \"Field Goal Percentage\",\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nthreept &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n   geom_line(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_point(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y= \"Three Point Percentage\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\norbpct + fgpct + threept +\n    plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Rockets Continue to Bounce Back.\",\n    subtitle = \"The Rockets may have a loss or two but continue to rebuild themselves.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Alana Ross\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the Rockets have really started to use rebounds to their advantage. Everything else is falling down. The Rockets field goals have fallen since 2020 and their three-point average is atrocious. The team was thriving off of three points in 2019 and just fell after that. 2019 was about five years ago. The Rockets can make a comeback. They just have to start using their rebounds to their advantage. Well if the Rockets rebounds are high then what does their turnover percentage look like?\n\n\nCode\ncurrent &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(season == 2023) |&gt; pull(team)\n\nrockets &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\n\n\navgtov &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; \n  filter(team %in% current) |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    avg_tov_pct = mean(tov_percent)\n  )\n\nhrtov &lt;- avgtov |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\n\nHR &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\nlastyear &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(season == \"2004\", team ==\"Houston Rockets\")\n\nbyteam &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbaadv, aes(x=reorder(team, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"light grey\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=HR, aes(x=reorder(team, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbyseason &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbaadv, aes(x=reorder(season, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"light grey\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=HR, aes(x=reorder(season, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nturnoverbyteam &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; group_by(team) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(tov_percent)) |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt=tov_percent)\n\nturnoverbyseason &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; group_by(season) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(tov_percent)) |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt=tov_percent)\n\nturnoverbyteam &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=avgtov, aes(x=reorder(team, avg_tov_pct), weight=avg_tov_pct), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=hrtov, aes(x=reorder(team, avg_tov_pct), weight=avg_tov_pct), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n labs(\n    x = \"Teams\",\n    y= \"Turnover Average\",\n  ) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\nturnoverbyseason &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=rockets, aes(x=reorder(season, season), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=lastyear, aes(x=reorder(season, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Seasons\",\n    y= \"Turnover Percent\",\n  ) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\nturnoverbyteam + turnoverbyseason +\n    plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Rockets Are Winning in Turnovers.\",\n    subtitle = \"The Rockets can never keep the ball in their court every year.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Alana Ross\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rockets have the second-highest average of turnovers to the Utah Jazz. The highest amount of turnovers they had was in 2004. They were still doing pretty good on wins and rebounds in 2004 though. The Rockets are a very interesting team because of this. As much as they turnover the ball they also collect their rebounds back.\nHow can the Rockets win a game then? The Rockets can win a game simply by collecting their rebounds and hitting three points again. The Rockets have done it before, so what’s stopping them from it again? Turning rebounds into three points and turnovers into rebounds can increase their field goal percentage. The Rockets will start winning games again and get at least closer to a championship. The Rockets have a chance to win a championship again if they would be willing to rebuild their team around saving turnovers to rebounds."
