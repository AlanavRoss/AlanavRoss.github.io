    "text": "The Houston Rockets have had their fair share of wins and overall great teams in many past seasons. The team has even won two National Basketball Association Championships in 1994 and 1995. In previous years, the Rockets have had a well-built team that played every area of the court. Yet, how have they evolved? They haven’t. They’ve regressed. Instead of playing to their strengths and seeking the chance to make it to the championships off of three points and rebounds, they have given over turnovers and made it fairly impossible to come back. Anyone who has watched the Houston Rockets play in the 1990s understands the excitement for a newly built team to collect wins back-to-back. It makes you wonder if the Houston Rockets can win another championship anytime soon.\nLet’s look at the Rockets through the years.\nSports Reference’s NBA site provides advanced information on the teams through the years. They happen to have wins and losses from different seasons.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nnbaadv &lt;- read.csv(\"nbateamadvanced.csv\")\n\ndiffnba &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; \n  mutate(Differential = w - l) |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  mutate(CumDiff = cumsum(Differential))\n\nHR &lt;- diffnba |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=diffnba, aes(x=season, y=CumDiff, group=team), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_step(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=CumDiff, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Seasons\",\n    y= \"Wins and Losses\",\n    title = \"The Rockets Have Fell Off\",\n    subtitle = \"The Rockets had a good win streak but are beginning to lose again.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference.com | By: Alana Ross\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Houston Rockets had fairly constant wins from 1994 to the early 2000s. The Rockets fell off going into the next 2010 decade and eventually came back. Let’s be honest, this is the beginning of the James Harden era. Mr. Fear the Beard brought a lot of success. Yet he left recently in 2019 and after the fact the win-to-loss rates are stagnant. The ratio stays stagnant until 2020 when there is a spike of wins until 2023. We start to fall off again.\nWhy do the Rockets fall off? Could it be rebounds? Could it be field goals? Could it be three-point averages? Maybe even a combination of all?\n\n\nCode\norbpct &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n   geom_line(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_point(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=orb_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y= \"Offensive Rebound Percentage\",\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nfgpct &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n   geom_line(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_point(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=e_fg_percent, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y= \"Field Goal Percentage\",\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nthreept &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=nbaadv, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"grey\")+\n   geom_line(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_point(data=HR, aes(x=season, y=x3p_ar, group=team), color=\"#CE1141\") +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y= \"Three Point Percentage\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\norbpct + fgpct + threept +\n    plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Rockets Continue to Bounce Back.\",\n    subtitle = \"The Rockets may have a loss or two but continue to rebuild themselves.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Alana Ross\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the Rockets have really started to use rebounds to their advantage. Everything else is falling down. The Rockets field goals have fallen since 2020 and their three-point average is atrocious. The team was thriving off of three points in 2019 and just fell after that. 2019 was about five years ago. The Rockets can make a comeback. They just have to start using their rebounds to their advantage. Well if the Rockets rebounds are high then what does their turnover percentage look like?\n\n\nCode\ncurrent &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(season == 2023) |&gt; pull(team)\n\nrockets &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\n\n\navgtov &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; \n  filter(team %in% current) |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    avg_tov_pct = mean(tov_percent)\n  )\n\nhrtov &lt;- avgtov |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\n\nHR &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(team == \"Houston Rockets\")\nlastyear &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; filter(season == \"2004\", team ==\"Houston Rockets\")\n\nbyteam &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbaadv, aes(x=reorder(team, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"light grey\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=HR, aes(x=reorder(team, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbyseason &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbaadv, aes(x=reorder(season, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"light grey\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=HR, aes(x=reorder(season, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nturnoverbyteam &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; group_by(team) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(tov_percent)) |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt=tov_percent)\n\nturnoverbyseason &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; group_by(season) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(tov_percent)) |&gt;\n  slice(1) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt=tov_percent)\n\nturnoverbyteam &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=avgtov, aes(x=reorder(team, avg_tov_pct), weight=avg_tov_pct), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=hrtov, aes(x=reorder(team, avg_tov_pct), weight=avg_tov_pct), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n labs(\n    x = \"Teams\",\n    y= \"Turnover Average\",\n  ) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\nturnoverbyseason &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=rockets, aes(x=reorder(season, season), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=lastyear, aes(x=reorder(season, tov_percent), weight=tov_percent), fill=\"#CE1141\") +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Seasons\",\n    y= \"Turnover Percent\",\n  ) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\nturnoverbyteam + turnoverbyseason +\n    plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Rockets Are Winning in Turnovers.\",\n    subtitle = \"The Rockets can never keep the ball in their court every year.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Alana Ross\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rockets have the second-highest average of turnovers to the Utah Jazz. The highest amount of turnovers they had was in 2004. They were still doing pretty good on wins and rebounds in 2004 though. The Rockets are a very interesting team because of this. As much as they turnover the ball they also collect their rebounds back.\nHow can the Rockets win a game then? The Rockets can win a game simply by collecting their rebounds and hitting three points again. The Rockets have done it before, so what’s stopping them from it again? Turning rebounds into three points and turnovers into rebounds can increase their field goal percentage. The Rockets will start winning games again and get at least closer to a championship. The Rockets have a chance to win a championship again if they would be willing to rebuild their team around saving turnovers to rebounds."

    "text": "The Boston Celtics have held over 17 championships in their career time and are one of the teams with the most championships in the NBA. This team is notable for having its bad days and then coming back better than ever. The Boston Celtics are one of the oldest teams and have been around since 1946. The team has evolved with basketball through the years and curated its brand. The constant hit of two points and three points on the court with a few rebounds to save a game is the way Boston has played for year. With notable names like Larry Bird and Bill Russell, the Celtics continue to keep their brand alive through its players. What does the Celtic’s change look like over the years? Have their players had growth over the years? Are they still one of the best teams?\nLet’s look at them through the years. For this particular question, data has only been gathered since 1994 because the Celtic’s last recent championship was in 2008. Since basketball has evolved via decades, this is a perfect year to begin it all with.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nnbaadv &lt;- read.csv(\"nbateamadvanced.csv\")\nbigbo &lt;- read_csv(\"allplayers5723.csv\")\n\ndiffnba &lt;- nbaadv |&gt; \n  mutate(Differential = w - l) |&gt; \n  group_by(team) |&gt; \n  mutate(CumDiff = cumsum(Differential))\n\nBC &lt;- diffnba |&gt; filter(team == \"Boston Celtics\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=diffnba, aes(x=season, y=CumDiff, group=team), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_step(data=BC, aes(x=season, y=CumDiff, group=team), color=\"#007A33\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Seasons\",\n    y= \"Wins and Losses\",\n    title = \"Boston Will Always Be Consistant Winners\",\n    subtitle = \"The Celtics has a steady pace of wins and do not drop often.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference.com | By: Alana Ross\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Boston Celtics have had steady years of wins and losses. They definitely could have more wins but their franchise has done a pretty good job of getting there. The team has had only a few sharp falls. After 2020 the team is climbing up once again. The Celtics almost take a championship once again against the Denver Nuggets. It’s not surprising to see how often the team crawls back up to take a championship.\nBoston is a fairly good team. This is good, but how many good players have they produced in their time? How many five-star players have they created and where do they stand against other teams?\n\n\nCode\ntop &lt;- c(\"LAL\"=47, \"PHI\"=37, \"BOS\"=34, \"GSW\"=33, \"NYK\"=29)\nLAL &lt;- c(\"Players\"=47)\nPHI &lt;- c(\"Players\"=37, 10)\nBOS &lt;- c(\"Players\"=34, 13)\nGSW &lt;- c(\"Players\"=33, 14)\nNYK &lt;- c(\"Players\"=29, 18)\n\niron(\n waffle(LAL, \n        rows = 2, \n        colors = c(\"#552583\", \"white\")\n        ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Laker's Offensive Players\",\n    title=\"The Celtics Continue to Produce Offensive players\", \n    subtitle=\"The Celtics are building offensive players better than the other teams.\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(PHI, \n        rows = 2, \n        x=\"Phillies's Offensive Players\", \n        colors = c(\"#E81828\", \"white\")\n        ),\n waffle(BOS, \n        rows = 2, \n        x=\"Boston's Offensive Players\", \n        colors = c(\"#007A33\", \"white\")\n        ),\n  waffle(GSW, \n        rows = 2, \n        x=\"Warrior's Offensive Players\", \n        colors = c(\"#FFC72C\", \"white\")\n        ),\n  waffle(NYK, \n        rows = 2, \n        colors = c(\"#F58426\", \"white\")\n        ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Warrior's Offensive Players\\n1 square = 1 player\",\n    caption=\"Source: SportsReference.com | Graphic by Alana Ross\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey actually sit in the top five! The Celtics collectively have produced 34 players that have ranked in the top five over the years. Now this has been since the franchise had begun. It comes to no surprised that the team had multiple players who were built and curated for nothing but basketball wins. This leads the Celtics to spot number three for having some of the best players. They aren’t too far behind the Lakers and Phillies. Okay, they’ve had some good players on their team throughout the years. This is good for a franchise. To be able to keep a stable and stagnant on-player production is great. Yet how are they doing rebound-wise?\n\n\nCode\nreboundingstack &lt;- bigbo |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt;= 1994 & Tm != \"TOT\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Tm) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Offensive = sum(ORB),\n    Defensive = sum(DRB)\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(20, wt=Defensive) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Tm, names_to = \"Type\", values_to = \"Rebounds\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=reboundingstack, aes(x=reorder(Tm, Rebounds), weight=Rebounds, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"darkgreen\",\"beige\")) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"NBA Teams\", \n    y=\"Average Rebounds Per Team\", \n    title=\"Defense Will Continue to Dominate\", \n    subtitle=\"The Celtics' defense is good, and they aren't getting enough rebounds.\", \n    caption=\"Source: SportsReference.com | By Alana Ross\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, another team that could turn rebounds into points. The Celtic’s defense is killing it lately, yet their rebound percentage isn’t sitting too steady. This team is at the bottom of the rest for 1994-present time. Other teams have climbed up. Yet this shows the Celtics keep a good hold on their ball, unlike the Rockets. Their defense is strong leading them to not often rebound the ball and collect it for a few more points in the game. The Celtics are solely an attack team that can push out points and keep it stagnant. So what does this mean for the franchise?\nThe Celtics are a fairly good team. They are well balanced in wins and losses and players as well. They focus on hitting points and defending the ball. This team is well-built and will continue to stay well-built over the years as they continue forward for their next championship. The franchise has the right idea and can only go up from there."
